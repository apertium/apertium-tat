* previous-state.txt.gz
	Concatenation of txt.gz files from apertium-tat/tests/morphotactics
	of the second to last revision of apertium-tat.

------

Basic workflow is like the following:
	1) mv expanded/current-state.txt.gz expanded/previous-state.txt.gz,
	2) fix what needs to be fixed (or added) in apertium-tat.tat.lexc,
	3) run './qa.sh tat' to see what consequences in the transducer your
	   changes had,
	4) if you are content with them, commit,
	
	repeat the cycle

'./qa.sh tat' in apertium-tat/ gives a diff of "previous" and "current" states.
